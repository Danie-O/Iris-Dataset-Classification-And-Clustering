# Iris-Dataset-Classification-And-Clustering

Analysis of the IRIS dataset, and modelling using popular classification and clustering algorithms such as:
- Logistic regression
- KNN classifier
- Decision tree
- Support vector machine (SVM)
- K-Means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN clustering 
- Gaussian Mixture Model

**Evaluation for each algorithm is also carries out using metrics such as; accuracy, precision, recall F1-score, and the silhouette score.**

Analysis of the IRIS dataset, and modelling using popular classification and clustering algorithms such as:
(Classification)
- Logistic regression
- KNN classifier
- Decision tree
- Support vector machine (SVM)

(Clustering)
- K-Means clustering
- Hierarchical clustering
- DBSCAN clustering 
- Gaussian Mixture Model

**Evaluation for each algorithm is also carried out using metrics such as; accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the silhouette score.**
